# Welcome to **DAVID AUDIO** ðŸŽ§  
A space where we break down **audio synthesis** and **audio processing** into easy-to-understand demonstrations,  
showing how theory directly applies to real-world audio applications.  

While thereâ€™s a wealth of resources on signals and systems, audio-specific guides are hard to come by.  
Here, we focus on bridging the gapâ€”offering clear examples that connect the dots between theory and its practical use in audio.
